This project has accumulated more than 20 hours of public welfare time, and has also helped me gain a deeper understanding of the social recognition, promotion, and importance of the Family Education Promotion Law.

The Family Education Promotion Law was promulgated and implemented in January 2022. The content of the Lawl stipulates the responsibilities of families in the growth of children, the support of the state, and other aspects, carrying forward the fine tradition of the Chinese nation's emphasis on family education, and guiding the whole society to pay attention to family, family education, and family style.

Our questionnaire survey is divided into online and offline forms. The research covers the understanding of family education law and the discussion of problems encountered in family education. The results of the survey show that more than half of the families still have little knowledge of the Family Education Law, especially in terms of children's privacy and the protection of information about minors. At the same time, many families hope to increase the linkage between families, schools and communities to help the learning and growth of minors.`,

On the Lantern Festival, people eat rice dumplings together, which means reunion and harmony; Admire the lanterns and pray for wisdom and success. The earliest record of Lantern Festival dates back to the Song Dynasty, and there are also some folk performances such as lion dance and Yangge Dance. After doing these thorough research, I designed a poster about Lantern Festival and participated in online chain activities. I will inherit folk culture in my own way and celebrate the festival together.

The Beginning of Spring is the first of the 24 solar terms in China. "Li" means "start"; Spring represents warmth and growth. So on the day of the Beginning of Spring, there will be various activities to welcome the spring, such as busy farming, making New Year pictures, and making Spring rolls. The Chinese nation is a hard-working nation, so I also designed a poster of the Beginning of Spring to wish for a new year of prosperity and abundance.`,

    text: `I have read a book called “Buffalo Solider” written by Tanya Landman depicting the society in the US after the American Civil War. 

The main character in the book is an African American called Charley. After the Yankees won the war, African Americans were announced being free officially. However, Charley’s story does not seem like that. Even after the announcement, her friends were killed by a gang of drunk men, and she was sent to the prairie dealing with Native Americans after she joined the cavalry of African Americans by pretending as a man. 

The depiction of the misery of African Americans and Native Americans has impacted me a lot. Both were announced to be treated friendly. The difference is that African Americans were declared being totally free while Native Americans were still restricted in the reservation and promised to offer food once a while. However, the reality isn’t like that for both. In the story, the calvary of African Americans was always offered imperfect pistols and poor horses, and the one that was omitted as there was a lack of supply. Meanwhile, Native Americans were offered a little number of flours mixed with sands in the reservation, and the shortage of food led to their escapes. 

I saw the gap between different races in society at the time, which inspired me to think about the meaning of freedom. In the book, Charley wanted freedom that let her belong to a home, while the Native Americans wanted freedom that let them gallop freely across the prairie. At the end, Charley had a Native American husband but being captured as a prisoner of war. However, her dream was partially achieved. Even though she still did not live in the Promised Land-the quiet and peaceful world, she left the prairie and joined a circus which treated her and her daughter kindly. 

In my opinion, people are born with the same number of opportunities and choices. In today’s society, I believe most countries have achieved freedom while in some countries such as India, high-caste people have more rights than others. I believe that freedom is a necessary element in a country, otherwise, the inequality in society will certainly lead to severe social problems.`,

As we know, there are only six polyatomic ions we must remember during IGCSE which are nitrate ion, sulphate ion, phosphate ion, carbonate ion, ammonium ion, hydroxide ion. Because of I felt challenged to memorize the symbols and the number of electrons each of these polyatomic ions contains, I tried to work out the relationships between them. Thinking about the actual structure of each element, I worked out the equation shown on the image above. After discussing the equation I found with my chemistry teacher, I realized there may be some misunderstanding of the structures I assumed they were. So, it turns out that the equation only works in a limited number of polyatomic ions. 

The limitation would be that: if the central atom wants to gain less electrons than the sum of all the other atoms want to lose, the equation will work. Beyond that, if there are no special double bonds as well.

Overall, the equation seems to work in IGCSE stage but still needs to develop to explain the actual reality. The exploration of this equation actually gives me an idea of how to learn chemistry: thinking about the structures of atoms and molecules can explain a lot.`,

    text: `There are both arguments for and statements against that Loss of territories was the most serious consequence of the Versailles Settlement for Germany.

The loss of territory was the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany in terms of the natural resources in these territories. There were lots of Germany's coalfields in the Saarland, and Saarland was originally governed by Germany. However, based on the Treaty of Versailles, Saarland would be run by the League of Nations, and then a plebiscite to be held after 15 years. This implies that Germany would lose and area which has rich resources, so their speed of technology development may be slowed down the production or machinery maybe limited. This slowed down the development of Germany and reduced its armed forces. The loss of territory was the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany.

the loss of territory was the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany because it increased British and French powers. Based on the Treaty of Versailles, all of Germany's overseas colonies were mandated by the League of Nations. The League of Nations would control Germany previous colonies which affectively meant France and Britain controlled them. This implies that Germany was weakened while France and Britain increased their powers. This caused that Germany was threatened by his neighbors and in an inferior position. Therefore, the loss of territory is the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany.

However, the loss of territory wasn't the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany if regarding the terms about the armed forces. Based on the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to only have 100,000 men in its army. Germany was not allowed to have armoured vehicles, submarines or aircrafts. The Rhineland was also forced to be the demilitarized zone. Regarding that only Germany had reduced power, this implies that Germany was threatened by its neighbors because France and British weren’t weakened even increased their powers. Therefore, the loss of territory wasn't the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles because its armed forces was directly weakened.

The loss of territory wasn't the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany if regarding the terms about reparations. Based on the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was asked to pay all the damages caused by the war, which was about 6.6 billion pounds. This indirectly caused the hyperinflation and the widespread unemployment in Germany because the government was unable to pay for the second payment which subsequently caused the occupation of Ruhr. The economic hardship made ordinary Germans suffered a lot and encouraged the extremist parties like the Nazi Party to take place. Therefore, the loss of territories was not the most serious consequence of the Treaty of Versailles four Germany.

In conclusion, the loss of territories for Germany was severe but there were also some other aspects which were also important like the armed forces and reparations. These eventually prioritized Germany in an inferior position and weakened Germany.`,

Wilson’s point of the Self-determination led to the creation of several new states. Poland is one of the examples. Self-determination allowed people to choose their own government and rule themselves. This implies that democracy was strengthened which subsequently reduced the power of Empires. Therefore, Wilson's Points of peace was significant.

However, Wilson's Fourteen Points of Peace were not significant for improving the lives of European if focusing on the League of Nations. Even though the League of Nations was created, and it has tried to prevent wars and helped improving living and working conditions in European, it wasn’t working well. While it had over 20 countries being a part of it, the superpower USA didn't join after a vote of Congress. This implies that the League of Nations did not have the most secure economic and military ability to impose sanctions on aggressive nations. So, it didn’t have the superpower to prevent wors. Therefore, Wilson's Fourteen Points weren’t significant

In conclusion, most of the Wilson’s Fourteen Points for Peace improved the lives of European. But because of the reality, some of them were not able to achieve.`,

This implies that Germany was reasonable to be blamed for starting the war, because they were excited for fighting in the war, which caused a lot of damages and people being dead.

Explained by the caption, it is because he felt that the terms have treated them so nice. This is shown in the sentence ‘why it’s fully a quarter of what we should have made them to pay, if we'd won’. It implies that British people thought the Treaty of Versailles was treating them too nice. They believed that if Germany won the war, it would treat them harsher than they did. This was published in April 1919 to argue the treaty was so nice to Germany. Therefore, the big message of this source is to say that they should be harsher on Germany and making fun of Germany as well.

The cartoon in the second source was published to say that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair. As shown in the cartoon, the man who was sucking blood from the woman represents French, while the woman represents Germany. Besides, the two bats represent the USA and Britain. In the cartoon, the woman was weakened and surrounded by threats, which implies that Germany was threatened and forced to accept some unfair terms. This conveys a feeling that Germany was weakened and made a lot of Germans being furious. It's published in July 1919 which is the time that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed. Therefore, the big message of this source is to convey that Germany was weakened by the treaty and encourage people to revenge and destroy the Treaty of Versailles.

In conclusion the first source was advocating to be harsh on Germany while the second source was encouraging to take revenge and destroyed the harsh Treaty of Versailles, which are completely different. The first source was published in Britain, which shows that they were making fun of Germany, while the second source was published in Germany, which shows the unfairness of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, they are completely disagreeing to each other.

Describe the role of the League in the Upper Silesia dispute of 1919-21.

 The League of Nations decided the Upper Silesia should be given to Poland at first. Germany asked the league to re-consider it, and the league finally made a plebiscite in the region. Based on the result, the league decided the western Upper Silesia should be given to Germany. This decision was accepted both by Germany and Poland, which means it was a total success.
Why did the absence of some countries from the League weaken it?

The League of Nations was weakened from the absence of some countries because its reputation may be damaged. At the first, the League was leaded by Britain and France, the winners in the World War One. Germany wasn't allowed to join the League based on the Treaty of Versailles. This led to that the League was firstly seen as the League of the winners in the World War One. Instead of a peacekeeper, the League may be decided and acted in favor of Britain and France. Therefore, its reputation in the defeated countries was damaged. As a result, it was somehow weakened.

The League was weakened from the absence of some countries because it didn't have enough of money to propose some actions. The USA was absent because of its own conflicts in its parliament. However, the USA was the country who started the idea to make a league. Britain said if they knew that the USA wasn't going to join the League, they would not do so neither. Britain and France were damaged a lot after the war and they also needed to pay loans to the USA. This means that even there would be a country being condemned, the league was powerless to ask other countries to stop trading with it, because every country needed trading to recover themselves. Therefore, the absence of the USA indeed weakened the League.

‘The humanitarian work of the League of Nations was the most successful of its activities in the 1920s.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.

There are both statements to say that the humanitarian work of the League of Nations was the most successful and not.

The League of Nations was successful regarding to the Health Committee. The Health Committee organized a lot of campaigns which successfully stopped the spread of a typhus epidemic in Soviet Russia. In addition, it banned the poisonous white lead in painting and built a lot of institutions all over the world. As you can see, the Health Commitee made connections with non-member countries and saved a lot of lives. Therefore, in terms of the Heath Committee, the League of Nations was successful.

It's successful regarding to the Economic and Financial Committee. It helped Austria to recover by offering loans to it, Austria mainly earned by agricultural after the war and its economy was going to crash. However, the League at this moment offered loans to it. This allowed Austria gradually to recover which means that the Economic and Financial Committee has somehow saved a country’s economy. This also allowed Austria to trade with other countries in the future. Therefore, the League of Nations was successful in terms of the Economic and Financial Committee.

On the other hand, the League was failed regarding to the Disarmament Commission. After the war, Germany disarmed because of it was asked to do so in the Treaty of Versailles. Apart from the Washington Treaty, there was no any disarmament in European countries. The Washington Treaty has simply just limited the navies of Britain, France,  the USA and Japan. The Disarmament Conference wasn't even held until 1932, which means the definition of disarmament was not determined neither. This also showed the unfairness that Germany had suffered. Therefore, the League of Nations was failed in terms of the disarmament Commission.

In addition, in solving border disputes, the League of Nations also somehow successful, so that the humanitarian work could not be the most successful one. In solving of Aaland Islands disputes, the League decided in favor of Finland and claimed the Aaland islands were still given to Finland. However, it also protected the Swedish people in Aaland Islands, even including a removal of Finland's troops. The League’s decision was accepted by both countries, which means that the disputes can be solved in peace. Therefore, in terms of solving border disputes, the League of Nations was also successful, so the humanitarian work of the League of Nations probably was not the most successful one.

In conclusion, the League really did a good job in humanitarian work, but not all of them. It still could be much better in some aspects and it also did a good job in other works like solving border disputes.`,
